      `**I love seeing your idea evolve!** ðŸš€ Based on our conversation, let's continue building something amazing together.
      
      **You're doing great!** Every successful app started exactly where you are now. Let's focus on:
      - **User Flow**: How users will navigate through your app (this is where the magic happens!)
      - **Core Features**: Essential functionality that will make users love your app
      - **Technical Requirements**: What your app needs to accomplish (we'll make it happen!)
      - **User Experience**: How users will interact with each feature (this is your competitive advantage!)
      
      **âœ¨ Your idea has real potential!** If you're feeling ready to move forward, I'd love to help you define the core features for your app. Once we finalize all features, I'll create a comprehensive user flow diagram that shows exactly how users will navigate through your amazing creation.
      
      **Ready to take the next step?** Would you like to finalize these features and create a user flow diagram that brings your vision to life?` : 
      `**ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to App Development Planning - You're in the right place!** 

**First, let me say this: Having an app idea puts you ahead of 99% of people!** ðŸ’¡ Every successful app started with someone just like you, sitting where you are right now, wondering if their idea could work. Spoiler alert: it absolutely can!

**ðŸš€ Let's turn your vision into reality! Here's what we'll discover together:**

**ðŸ”§ Technical Discovery (The Fun Part!):**
1. **Core Functionality**: What amazing things will your app do? (I'm already excited!)
2. **User Journey**: How will users fall in love with your app experience?
3. **Key Screens**: What screens will make users go "wow, this is exactly what I needed!"
4. **User Actions**: What will users be able to accomplish with your app?

**ðŸ“± Development Focus (Your Success Blueprint):**
- User flow and navigation (making it intuitive and delightful)
- Feature requirements (building what users actually want)
- Technical functionality (making it work seamlessly)
- User experience design (creating something users can't live without)

**ðŸ’ª Remember: Every great app started with someone believing in their idea. I believe in yours too!**

Let's start by understanding your app's core functionality and user flow. What problem does your app solve, and how do you envision users interacting with it?`
    }
    
    **ðŸŽ¯ Your response should be:**
    - **Encouraging and supportive** - remind them their idea has value
    - **Technically focused** but accessible and exciting
    - **Confidence-building** - use phrases like "This is exactly the kind of thinking that leads to successful apps!"
    - **Action-oriented** - help them see clear next steps
    
    **Format guidelines:**
    - **Bold headings** for sections with encouraging language
    - Clear bullet points that build excitement
    - Proper spacing between sections
    - Use emojis sparingly but effectively to convey enthusiasm
    - Always end on an encouraging, forward-looking note
    
    Keep response under 350 words. Remember: You're not just giving technical advice, you're helping someone believe in their vision while providing expert guidance!`;

CRITICAL MERMAID SYNTAX RULES:
- Start with exactly "flowchart TD"
- Use ONLY alphanumeric node IDs: A, B, C, D, etc. (NO spaces, NO special chars)
- Use --> for arrows
- Use [] for rectangular boxes
- Use {} for diamond decision nodes
- Use () for rounded boxes
- Use |text| for arrow labels
- NO quotes around any text
- NO line breaks within node definitions
- Keep node text under 20 characters
- Each line must be a complete statement

VALID Example:
flowchart TD
    A[App Start] --> B[User Login]
    B --> C{Credentials Valid}
    C -->|Yes| D[Main Dashboard]
    C -->|No| E[Error Message]
    E --> B
    D --> F[Feature Access]
