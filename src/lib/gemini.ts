      If they're asking about implementation or seem ready for the next step, you can suggest: "Great! It sounds like you have a solid understanding of your idea.

Instead of jumping straight into technical details, let's brainstorm together:

1. What problem does your idea solve? Who would benefit from it?
2. What are the core features you envision? 
3. What makes your idea unique or different?
4. Who is your target audience?

Let's explore these aspects first before we create any flowcharts. I want to make sure we capture the full vision of your idea and help you feel confident about it!`

STRICT FORMAT RULES:
- Start with "flowchart TD"
- Use simple node IDs: A, B, C, D, etc.
- Use --> for arrows
- Use [] for boxes, {} for decisions
- No quotes around text
- No special characters in node IDs
- Keep text simple and short

Example:
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[Login]
    B --> C{Valid?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Dashboard]
    C -->|No| B

Generate ONLY the flowchart code:`;
